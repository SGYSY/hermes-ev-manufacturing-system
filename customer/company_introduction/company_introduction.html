      <h1>Welcome to Hermes</h1>
      <h2>Our Company Structure and Operation</h2>
      <p>Hermes is a company focusing on electric vehicle manufacturing, with complete branches, departments, employee architecture, raw materials supply, vehicle production, inventory management, and customer sales and stores controlling system.</p>
      <p>Firstly, Hermes is an automotive manufacturing company whose database design provides a well thought out structure covering the core components of the business such as assets, branches, divisions, and employees. The design supports not only operational but also administrative functions, reflecting the complexity of the company's organizational structure.</p>
      <p>Hermes is organized into multiple branches, each representing a geographical location. These branches can not only operate independently but also exist in hierarchical relationships where larger main branches can oversee smaller sub-branches, a structure that helps the company track the performance and role of each branch.</p>
      <p>Hermes organizes its internal functions through departments, which are responsible for specific areas such as production, finance, or logistics. Similar to branches, a hierarchical structure has formed between departments, making management within the company more specialized.</p>

      <h2>Upstream and Downstream Production</h2>
      <p>Secondly, Hermes' organization structure for upstream and downstream production is designed for efficiency in processing the raw material into finished products, while meeting market demands. In terms of supply chain management, upstream focuses on raw materials such as lithium and aluminum, as well as materials provided by suppliers, including batteries, motors, and body materials, and tracks and manages these materials. Downstream operations involve converting these materials into finished products, which are then sold to customers.</p>
      <p>Upstream production is particularly focused on supplying important raw materials such as lithium, as well as key components such as batteries. Hermes invests in the lithium supply chain and has partnerships with major battery suppliers. A variety of factors are considered when purchasing, including supplier selection, demand analysis, and order management, to ensure that materials are delivered on time.</p>
      <p>Downstream production takes place primarily within the company's plants, each of which focuses on the manufacturing of a specific product line. After receiving raw materials and supplier materials, the factory will proceed with production according to the scheduled schedule. After production is completed, the vehicle is stored in an inventory warehouse, waiting for the sale of customer orders. Relying on company-owned stores, Hermes has an effective order and inventory management system to ensure timely delivery.</p>
      <p>Hermes' organizational structure ensures a close connection between upstream and downstream production.</p>
